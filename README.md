The `c3t` package in R is a powerful tool for regionalization and
clustering tasks with various constraints. It offers a range of
functions to facilitate these tasks, and its capabilities include:

### 1. Hierarchical Regionalization (AHR)

- Solve regionalization problems while respecting constraints such as
  minimum and maximum size.
- Apply a modified Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC)
  algorithm.
- Choose from various linkage methods to define cluster proximity.
- Apply constraints on the merging process to ensure specific criteria
  are met.

### 2. Improving Feasible Solutions

- Enhance feasible solutions while preserving constraints.
- Optimize solutions according to user-defined criteria.
- Explore different linkage methods for clustering.

### 3. Addressing Unfeasible Solutions

- Convert unfeasible solutions into feasible ones.
- Adjust cluster sizes to meet constraints.
- Maintain contiguity and other specified criteria.

### 4. Flexible Parameter Customization

- Choose distance measures, such as Euclidean distance.
- Set minimum and maximum size constraints for regions.
- Specify initial partitions for improved results.
- Apply various criteria for evaluation, including Calinski-Harabasz
  index (CHI).

### 5. Versatility in Constraints

- Customize constraints based on your specific requirements.
- Ensure contiguity and size constraints are met.
- Explore different fusion constraint modes.

### 6. Detailed Documentation

- Comprehensive documentation to guide users through each function.
- Examples and explanations of available options.

The `c3t` package is a versatile and robust solution for addressing
regionalization and clustering problems with constraints, making it a
valuable tool for spatial analysis and geographic research.

For detailed information on function usage and options, please refer to
the package documentation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Before we begin, ensure you have the `c3t` package and the required
dependencies installed. You can do this by running the following
commands:

``` r
library(c3t)
library(dplyr)
```

### Creating a Grid

Let‚Äôs start by creating a fictitious grid, which will serve as an
example for using different functions. We can generate this grid using
the `gen_grid` function. You can specify the number of individuals on
the grid, empty cells, and metropolitan areas.

``` r
set.seed(123L)
x <- 4L
y <- 5L
nbIndividuals <- 100L
nbCasesVides <- 3L
nbMetropolises <- 2L
nbVariablesQuant <- 2L

grille <- gen_grid(x, y, nbIndividuals = nbIndividuals,
                   nbMinEmptyZones = nbCasesVides,
                   nbMetropolises = nbMetropolises,
                   nbQuantitatives = nbVariablesQuant)

data <- grille$context
individus <- grille$repartition$nbIndividuals
contiguite <- grille$contiguity
```

### Hierarchical Regionalization (AHR)

To address regionalization problems with constraints like minimum and
maximum size, you can use the `AHR` function. This function applies a
modified Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) algorithm while
respecting contiguity and size constraints.

``` r
resRAH <- AHR(contiguity = contiguite,
              d = "euclidean", data = data,
              sizes = individus,
              m = 5.0, M = 40.0,
              criteria = "CHI",
              fusionConstraints = available_fusion_constraints(),
              fusionConstraintModes = available_fusion_modes(),
              parallele = FALSE)
#> ‚Ñπ Starting time: 2023-09-14 12:56:36.87824
#> ‚Ñπ 45 AHC to evaluate
#> ‚Üí 362 non-trivial regionalisations obtained
#> ‚úî 62 feasable partitions obtained
#> ‚Üí 19 redundancies have been removed.
#> ‚Üí Calculation of the CHI criterion
#> ‚Üí Execution time: 6.40905380249023
```

The function returns a list of feasible solutions, and you can select
the one that best suits your needs.

### Improving Feasible Solutions

Once you have a feasible solution, you can further enhance it while
preserving constraints using the `enhance_feasible` function.

``` r
resEnhance <- enhance_feasible(regionalisation = resRAH$results$partition[[1L]],
                               contiguity = contiguite,
                               d = "euclidean", data = data,
                               sizes = individus,
                               m = 5.0, M = 40.0,
                               enhanceCriteria = c("AHC", "CHI"),
                               linkages = c("single", "complete"),
                               parallele = FALSE,
                               verbose = TRUE)
#> ‚Üí Evaluation of the 3 enhancements
#> ‚Üí Calculation of 1 evaluation criteria on the initial partition
#> ‚Üí Calcul of 1 evaluation criteria on the 3 enhanced partitions
```

This function allows you to improve your solution according to specified
criteria.

### Addressing Unfeasible Solutions

In cases where a feasible solution cannot be obtained, the
`resolve_unfeasible` function attempts to provide a feasible solution
from an unfeasible one.

``` r
regInfaisable <- c(1L, 2L, 3L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 4L,
                   4L, 2L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L)

resolution <- resolve_unfeasible(contiguity = contiguite,
                                 sizes = individus,
                                 data = data,
                                 d = "euclidean", m = 5.0, M = 40.0,
                                 regionalisation = regInfaisable,
                                 verbose = TRUE)
#> ‚Üí Transfert of elements one-by-one
#> ‚úî fully resolved partition
```

This function aims to transform an unfeasible solution into a feasible
one while respecting constraints.
