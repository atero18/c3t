# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("atero18/c3t")
```

## 📍 Overview

[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)

The `c3t` package in R is a powerful tool for regionalization and clustering tasks with various constraints. It offers a range of functions to facilitate these tasks, and its capabilities include:

### 1. Hierarchical Regionalization (AHR)

- Solve regionalization problems while respecting constraints such as minimum and maximum size.
- Apply a modified [Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hierarchical_clustering#introduction) (AHC) algorithm.
- Choose from various linkage methods to define cluster proximity.
- Apply constraints on the merging process to ensure specific criteria are met.

### 2. Improving Feasible Solutions

- Enhance feasible solutions while preserving constraints.
- Optimize solutions according to user-defined criteria.
- Explore different linkage methods for clustering.

### 3. Addressing Unfeasible Solutions

- Convert unfeasible solutions into feasible ones.
- Adjust cluster sizes to meet constraints.
- Maintain contiguity and other specified criteria.

### 4. Flexible Parameter Customization

- Choose distance measures, such as Euclidean distance.
- Set minimum and maximum size constraints for regions.
- Specify initial partitions for improved results.
- Apply various criteria for evaluation, including Caliński-Harabasz index (CHI) [@calinski_dendrite_1974].

### 5. Versatility in Constraints

- Customize constraints based on your specific requirements.
- Ensure contiguity and size constraints are met.
- Explore different fusion constraint modes.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Before we begin, ensure you have the `c3t` package and the required dependencies installed. You can do this by running the following commands:

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load the c3t package
library(c3t)
```

### Creating a Grid

Let's start by creating a fictitious grid, which will serve as an example for using different functions. We can generate this grid using the `gen_grid` function. You can specify the number of individuals on the grid, empty cells, and metropolitan areas.

```{r grid_creation}
set.seed(123L)
x <- 4L
y <- 5L
nbIndividuals <- 100L
nbEmptyZones <- 3L
nbMetropolises <- 2L
nbVariablesQuant <- 2L

grid <- gen_grid(x, y, nbIndividuals = nbIndividuals,
                 nbMinEmptyZones = nbEmptyZones,
                 nbMetropolises = nbMetropolises,
                 nbQuantitatives = nbVariablesQuant)

data <- grid$context
individuals <- grid$repartition$nbIndividuals
contiguity <- grid$contiguity
```

### Hierarchical Regionalization (AHR)

To address regionalization problems with constraints like minimum and maximum size, you can use the `AHR` function. This function applies a modified Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) algorithm while respecting contiguity and size constraints.

```{r AHR}
resAHR <- AHR(contiguity = contiguity,
              d = "euclidean", data = data,
              sizes = individuals,
              m = 5.0, M = 40.0,
              criteria = "CHI",
              fusionConstraints = available_fusion_constraints(),
              fusionConstraintModes = available_fusion_modes(),
              parallel = FALSE)
```

The function returns a list of feasible solutions, and you can select the one that best suits your needs.

### Improving Feasible Solutions

Once you have a feasible solution, you can further enhance it while preserving constraints using the `enhance_feasible` function.

```{r enchancement}
resEnhance <-
  enhance_feasible(regionalisation = resAHR$results$partition[[1L]],
                   contiguity = contiguity,
                   d = "euclidean", data = data,
                   sizes = individuals,
                   m = 5.0, M = 40.0,
                   enhanceCriteria = c("AHC", "CHI"),
                   linkages = c("single", "complete"),
                   parallel = FALSE,
                   verbose = TRUE)
```

This function allows you to improve your solution according to specified criteria.

### Addressing Unfeasible Solutions

In cases where a feasible solution cannot be obtained, the `resolve_unfeasible` function attempts to provide a feasible solution from an unfeasible one.

```{r resolve_unfeasible}
unfeasibleReg <- c(1L, 2L, 3L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 4L,
                   4L, 2L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L)

resolution <- resolve_unfeasible(contiguity = contiguity,
                                 sizes = individuals,
                                 data = data,
                                 d = "euclidean", m = 5.0, M = 40.0,
                                 regionalisation = unfeasibleReg,
                                 verbose = TRUE)
```

This function aims to transform an unfeasible solution into a feasible one while respecting constraints.
