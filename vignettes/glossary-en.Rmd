Here is a list of some terms used in the context of this package and their definitions.


# A 

- **AGNES** : Agglomerative nesting
- **AHC** : Agglomerative hierarchical clustering
- **AHR** : Agglomerative hierarchical regionalisation
- **Articulation point** : Vertex of a graph whose removal increases the number of connected components (separator set consisting of a single vertex)


# C 

- **CHI** : Calin≈Ñki-harabasz index
- **CLINK** : Complete linkage
- **Coarse partition** : Partition composed of a single cluster
- **Compact cluster** : Homogeneous cluster
- **Compact partition** : Partition where all clusters are compact
- **Complete graph** : Simple graph in which all nodes are adjacent to each other
- **Connected component** : Maximal connected subset with respect to inclusion
- **Connected graph** : Undirected graph where any vertex is accessible from any other vertex by passing only through the vertices of this set


# F 

- **Feasible solution** : A partition that respects all constraints (contiguity, size...)
- **Finite graph** : Graph with a finite number of vertices


# I 

- **Interior boundary of a partition** : Set of elements contiguous to an element of another cluster


# M 

- **Minimal separator set** : Separator set such that no strict subset is a separator set


# R 

- **Region** : Connected cluster
- **Regionalisation** : Partition where all clusters are regions
- **Regionalization** : Partition where all clusters are regions


# S 

- **SLINK** : Single linkage
- **Separate partition** : Partition where all clusters are well separated pairwise
- **Separator set** : Set of vertices of an undirected graph whose removal would create more connected components
- **Simple undirected graph** : Undirected graph without loops and in which each pair of vertices has at most one edge


# T 

- **Totally contiguous** : Set in which each element is contiguous with all the others. The associated contiguity graph is complete.
- **Transferrable point** : For regionalization, a point that can be transmitted from one region to another while maintaining the connectivity of the regions
- **Trivial partition** : Partition composed of one cluster per element of the set


# V 

- **Vertex connectivity degree** : For a non-empty connected undirected graph, the cardinality of the smallest separator set
